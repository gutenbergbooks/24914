<h3><i>A PROLOGUE TO BE SPOKEN BY BETSY</i></h3>


<p><i>Our scene is the wind-swept coast of Devon. By day there is a wide
stretch of ocean far below, and the abutments of our stage arise from
a dizzy cliff.</i></p>

<p><i>The time is remote, and ships of forgotten build stand out from
Bristol in full sail for the mines of India. But we must be loose and
free of precise date lest our plot be shamed by broken fact. A
thousand years are but as yesterday. We make but a general gesture to
the dim spaces of the past.</i></p>

<p><i>The village of Clovelly climbs in a single street&mdash;a staircase,
really&mdash;and it is fagged and out of breath half way. But far above, on
a stormy crag, clinging by its toes, there stands a pirates' hut. To
this topmost ledge fishwives sometimes scramble by day; but when a
wind shall search the crannies of the night, then no villager would
dare to climb so high.</i></p>

<p><i>You will seek today in vain the pirates' cabin. Since the adventure
of our play a thousands tempests have snarled across these rocks. You
must convince your reason that these pinnacles of yesteryear, toppled
down by storm, lie buried in the sea.</i></p>

<p><i>We had hoped that our drama's scene might lie on a pirate ship at
sea. We had wished for a swaying mast, full-set with canvas&mdash;a typhoon
to smother our stage in wind. We had hoped to walk a victim off the
plank, with the sea roaring in the wings. But our plot deals
stubbornly with us. Alas, our pirates grow old and stiff. They have
retired, as we say, from active practice and live in easy luxury on
shore. Yet we shall see that their villany still thrives.</i></p>

<p><i>How shall we select a name for our frightful play? There is a wharf
in London that is known as Wapping. In these days that we call the
present it has sunk to common use and its rotten timbers are piled
with honest unromantic merchandise. But once a gibbet stood on Wapping
Wharf, and pirates were hanged upon it. It was the first convenient
harborage for inbound ships to dispose of this dirty deep-sea cargo.
So it was the somber motif of a pirate's life&mdash;his moment of
reflection after he had slit his victim's throat.</i></p>

<p><i>Tonight, although your beards grow long and Time has marked its net
of wrinkles&mdash;tonight, the years spin backwards. Only the young in
heart will catch the slender meaning of our play.</i></p>

<p><i>We are too quick to think that childhood passes with the years&mdash;that
its fine fancy is blunted with the practice of the world. Too long
have we been taught that the clouds of glory fade in the common day.
If a man permits, a child keeps house within his heart.</i></p>

<p><i>Our prologue outstays its time. Already the captain of our pirates
puts on his hook. The evil Duke limps for practice on his wooden leg.
Presently our curtain will rise. We shall see the pirates' cabin, with
the lighthouse in the distance, Flint's lantern and the ladder to the
sleeping-loft. We shall hear a storm unparalleled&mdash;thunder, lightning
and a rush of wind, if it can be managed.</i></p>

<p><i>Then our candles burn to socket. Our pasteboard cabin grows dark. The
blustering ocean, the dizzy cliffs of Devon, melt like an
unsubstantial pageant. Once again, despite the signpost of the years,
we have run on the "laughing avenues of childhood."</i></p>

<h3>BY WAY OF EXPLANATION</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="dropcap">S</span><b>EVERAL</b> weeks ago an actor-manager requested me to try my hand at a
play for the winter season. The offer was unexpected. "My dear sir," I
said, "I am immensely flattered, but I have never written a play."
Then I hastened to ask, "What kind of play?" for fear the offer might
be withdrawn. He replied with sureness and decision. "I want a play,"
he said, "with lots of pirates and&mdash;no poetry." He stressed this with
emphatic gesture. "And at least one shooting," he added. It was a slim
prescription. He left me to brood upon the matter.</p>

<p>The proposal was too flattering to be rejected out of hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>After a furious week upon a plot and dialogue, I was given an
opportunity to display my wares. The manager himself met me in the
hallway. "Is there a shooting?" he asked, with what seemed almost a
suppressed excitement. I was able to satisfy him and he led me to his
inner office, where he pointed out an easy chair. The room was
pleasantly furnished with bookshelves to the ceiling. Evidently his
former ventures had been prosperous, and already I imagined myself
come to fortune as his partner. While I fumbled with embarrassment at
my papers&mdash;for I dreaded his severe opinion&mdash;he himself fetched a
basket of coal for a fire that burned briskly on the hearth. Then he
sat rigidly at attention.</p>

<p>It now appeared that he had summoned to our conference several of his
associates&mdash;the subordinates, merely, of his ventures&mdash;his manager of
finance (with a sharp eye for a business flaw), his costumer and
designer, and another person who is his reader and adviser and, in
emergency, fills and mends any sudden gap that shows itself.</p>

<p>My notion of theatrical managers has been that they are a cold and
distant race&mdash;the more sullen cousin of an editor. Is it not
considered that on the reading of a play they sit with fallen chin,
and that they chill an author to reduce his royalty? It is naught, it
is naught, saith the buyer. I am told that even the best plays are
hawked with disregard from theatre to theatre, until the hun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>gry
author is out at elbow. They get less civility than greets a mean
commodity. Worthless mining shares and shoddy gilt editions do not
kick their heels with such disregard in the outer office. Popcorn and
apples&mdash;Armenian laces, even&mdash;beg a quicker audience.</p>

<p>But none of this usual brusqueness appeared. Rather, he showed an
agreeable enthusiasm as we proceeded&mdash;even an unrestraint, which, I
must confess, at times somewhat marred his repose and dignity.
Manifestly it was not his intention to depreciate my wares. He
exchanged frank glances of approval with his subordinates&mdash;with his
costumer especially, with whom his relation seems the closest.</p>

<p>In the first act of my play, when it becomes apparent that one of my
pirates goes stumping on a timber leg, his eye flashed. And when it
was disclosed that the captain wears a hook instead of hand, he forgot
his professional restraint and cried out his satisfaction. He was soon
wrapped in thought by the mysterious behaviour of the fortune-teller
and he said, if she were short and stout, he had the very actress in
his mind.</p>

<p>But it was in the second act that he threw caution to the winds. As
you will know presently, Red Joe&mdash;one of my pirates&mdash;seizes his trusty
gun and, taking breathless aim, shoots&mdash;But I must not expose my plot.
At this exciting moment (which is quite the climax of my play)
Belasco&mdash;or any of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span> his kind&mdash;would have squinted for a flaw. He would
have tilted his wary nose upon the ceiling and told me that my plot
was humbug. What sailorman would mistake a lantern for a lighthouse?
Nor were there lighthouses in the days of the buccaneers. He would
have scuttled my play in dock and grinned at the rising bubbles. Mark
the difference! My manager, ignoring these inconsequential errors,
burst from his chair&mdash;this is amazing!&mdash;and turned a reckless
somersault between the table and the fire.</p>

<p>His costumer, who knows best how his eccentricity runs to riot,
checked him for this and sent him to his chair. He sobered for a
minute and the play went on. Presently, however, when the enraged
pirates gathered to wreak vengeance on their victim, I saw how deeply
he was moved. His exultant eye sought the bookshelves, and I fancy
that he was in meditation whether he might be allowed a handstand with
his heels waving against the ceiling. His excited fingers obviously
were searching for a dagger in his boot.</p>

<p>You may conceive my pleasure. If his cold and practiced judgment could
be so stirred, might I not hope that the phlegmatic pit in shiny
shirt-fronts would rise and shout its approval at our opening? And to
what reckless license might not the gallery yield? I fancied a burst
of somersaults in the upper gloom, and tremendous handsprings&mdash;both
men and women&mdash;down the sharp-pitched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span> aisle. It would be
shocking&mdash;this giddy flash of lingerie&mdash;except that our broader times
now give it countenance. Peeping Tom, late of Coventry, in these more
generous days need no longer sit like a sneak at his private shutter.
He has only to travel to the beach where a hundred Godivas crowd the
sands. I saw myself on the great occasion of our opening night bowing
in white tie from the forward box.</p>

<p>Our conference was successful. When the reading of the play was
finished and the wicked pirates stood in the shadow of the gibbet, he
thanked me and excused himself from further attendance by reason of a
prior engagement. Under the stress of selection for his theatre he
cannot sleep at night, and his costumer wisely packs him off early to
his bed. She whispers to me, however, that although he had hopes for a
storm at sea and a hanging at the end, his decision, nevertheless, is
cast in my favor for a quick production, whenever a worthy company can
be assembled.</p>

<p><img src="images/sword.png" width="243" height="176" alt="sword" title="sword" class="floatr" />
<span class="floatcapr1">On the tip of each he has bargained for a spot of red</span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But</span> we have gone still further toward our opening. The manager has
already whittled a dozen daggers and they lie somewhere on a shelf,
awaiting a coat of silver paint. On the tip of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span> each he has bargained
for a spot of red. Furthermore, he owns a pistol&mdash;a harmless,
devicerated thing&mdash;and he pops it daily at any rogue that may be
lurking on the cellar stairs.</p>

<p>All pirates wear pigtails&mdash;pirates, that is, of the upper crust (the
Kidds and Flints and Morgans)&mdash;and at first this was a knotty problem.
But he obtained a number of old stockings&mdash;stockings, of course,
beyond the skill of that versatile person who mends the gaps&mdash;and he
has wound them on wires, curling them upward at the end and tieing
them with bits of ribbon. The pirate captain is allowed an extra inch
of pigtail to exalt him above his fellows. When he first adjusted this
pigtail on himself, his costumer cried out that he looked like a
Chinaman. This was downright stupidity and was hardly worthy of her
perception; but ladies cannot be expected to recognize a pirate so
instinctively as we rougher men. The stocking, however, was clipped to
half its length, and now he is every inch a buccaneer.</p>

<p>As for the captain's hook, he is resourcefulness itself. These things
are secrets of the craft, but I may hint that there is a very suitable
hook in a butchershop around the corner. Surely the butcher&mdash;warmed to
generosity by the family patronage&mdash;would lend it for the great
performance. I have no doubt but that the manager, from this time
forward, will beg all errands in his direction and that his smile will
thaw the friendly butcher to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span> his purpose. Certainly two legs of lamb,
if whispered that the drama is at stake, will consent to hang for one
tremendous day upon a single hook. Our hook is to be screwed into a
block of wood, and there is something about knuckles and a cord around
the wrist and a long sleeve to cover up the joining. Anyway, the
problem has been met.</p>

<p class="center"><br />

</p>

<p class="caption">His smile will thaw the friendly butcher to his
purpose<br /><br /></p>

<p>In the furnace room he has found a heavy sheet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span> of tin for the thunder
storm, and I have suggested that he dig in a nearby gravel pit for a
basket of rain to hurl against the pirates' window. But hard beans, he
says, are better, and he has won the cook's consent. For the slow
monotone of water dripping from the roof in our second act, a single
bean, he tells me, dropped gently in a pan is a baffling counterfeit.</p>

<p>The lightning seems not to bother him, for he owns a pocket
flashlight; but the mighty wind that comes brawling from the ocean was
at first a sticker. The vacuum cleaner popped into his head, but was
put aside. The fireplace bellows were too feeble for any wind that had
grown a beard. His manager of finance, however, laid aside his book
one night&mdash;a weary tract upon the law&mdash;and displayed an ability to
moan and whistle through his teeth. The very casement rattled in the
blast. He has agreed to sit in the wings and loose a sufficient storm
upon a given signal.</p>

<p>Our stage is cramped. Three strides stretch from side to side. "Can
this cockpit" you ask, "hold the vasty fields of France?" It is not,
of course, the vasty fields of France that we are trying to hold; but
we do lack space for the kind of riot the manager has in mind in the
final scene. He wants nothing girlish. Sabers and pistols are his
demand&mdash;a knife between the teeth&mdash;and more yelling than I could
possibly put down in print. A bench must be upset, the beer-cask
overturned, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span> jug of Darlin's grog spilled, and one stool, at least,
must be smashed&mdash;preferably on the captain's head, who must, however,
be consulted. Patch-Eye and the Duke are not the kind of pirates that
lie down and whine for mercy at a single punch.</p>

<p>At first our manager was baffled how the pirates were to ascend a
ladder to their sleeping loft. They had no place to go. They would
crack their ugly heads upon the ceiling. The costumer was positive
(parsimony!) that a hole&mdash;even a little hole&mdash;should not be cut in the
plaster overhead for their disappearance. If the chandelier had been
an honest piece of metal they might have perched on it until the act
ran out. Or perhaps the candles could be extinguished when their legs
were still climbing visibly. At last the manager has contrived that a
plank be laid across the tops of two step-ladders, behind a drop so
that the audience cannot see. No reasonable pirate could refuse to
squat upon the plank until the curtain fell.</p>

<p><img src="images/finger.png" width="305" height="178" alt="finger" title="finger" class="floatr" />
<span class="floatcapr2">With uncertain, questing finger</span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We</span> are getting on. Our company has been selected. We need only a
handful of actors, but the manager has enlisted the street. The
dearest little girl has been chosen for Betsy, and each day she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
practices her lullaby at the piano with uncertain, questing finger. A
gentle rowdy of twelve will speak the Duke's blood-curdling lines. I
understand that two quarrelsome pirates have nearly come to blows
which shall act the captain. The hero, Red Joe, will be played by the
manager himself, for it is he who owns the pistol. Is not the boy who
has the baseball the captain of his nine?</p>

<p>I owe an apology to all the mothers of our cast; for the rough
language of my lines outweighs their gentler home instruction.
Whenever several of our actors meet there is used the vile language of
the sea. By the bones of my ten fingers has replaced the anemic oaths
of childhood. One little girl has been told she cries as easily as a
crocodile. Another little girl was heard to say she would slit her
sister's <i>wisdom</i>&mdash;a slip, no doubt, for <i>wizen</i>. And Blast my lamps!
and Sink my timbers! are rolled profanely on the tongue.</p>

<p>In every attic on the street a rakish craft flies the skull and
crossbones, and roves the Spanish Main on rainy afternoons. Innocent
victims&mdash;girls, chiefly, who will tattle unless a horrid threat is
laid upon them&mdash;are forced blindfold to walk the plank. If the wind
blows, scratching the trees against the roof, it is, by their desire,
a tempest whirling their stout ship upon the rocks. What ho! We split!
Mysterious chalkings mark the cellar stairs and hint of treasure
buried in the coal-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>hole. At every mirror pirates practice their cruel
faces.</p>

<p class="caption">Innocent victims ... are forced blindfold to walk the

<p>And now the daggers are complete, and their tip of blood has been
squeezed from its twisted tube. Chests and neighbors have been
rummaged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span> for outlandish costumes. From the kindling-pile a
predestined stick has become the timber leg of the wicked Duke. The
butcher's hook has yielded to persuasion.</p>

<p>Presently rehearsals will begin&mdash;</p>

<hr class="med" />

<p>I have been reading lately, and I have come on a sentence with which I
am in disagreement. I shall not tell the name of the book (mere
mulishness!) but I hope you know it or can guess. It is a tale of
children and of a runaway perambulator and of folk who never quite
grew up, with just a flick of inquiry&mdash;a slightest gesture now and
then&mdash;toward precious rascals like our Patch-Eye and the Duke. Its
author stands, in my opinion, a better chance of our lasting memory
than any writer living.</p>

<p>If you have read this book, you have known in its author a man who is
himself a child&mdash;one from whom the years have never taken toll. And if
you have lingered from page to page, you know what humor is, and love
and gentleness. I think that children must have clambered on his
familiar knee and that he learned his plot from their trustful eyes.</p>

<p>Someone has been reading my very copy of this book, for it is marked
with pencil and whole chapters have been thumbed. I would like to know
who this reader is&mdash;a woman, beyond a doubt&mdash;who has dug in this
fashion to the author's heart. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span> the book is from a lending
library. She is only a number pasted inside the cover, a date that
warns her against a fine.</p>

<p>Her pencil has marked the words to a richer cadence. I like to think
that she has children of her own and that she read the book at
twilight in the nursery, and that its mirth was shared from bed to
bed. But the pathetic parts she did not read aloud, fearing to see
tears in her children's eyes. Before her own at times there must have
floated a mist. She is a gracious creature, I am sure, with a
gentleness that only a mother knows who sits with drowsy children. And
now that it is my turn to read the book&mdash;for so does fancy urge me&mdash;I
hear her voice and the echo of her children's laughter among the
pages.</p>

<p>It is a book about a great many things&mdash;about David and about a
sausage machine, about a little dog which was supposed to have been
caught up by mistake. But when the handle was reversed out he came,
whole and complete except that his bark was missing. A sausage still
stuck to his tail, which presently he ate. And it proved to be his
bark, for at the last bite of the sausage his bark returned. And David
took his salty handkerchief from his eyes and laughed. There is a
chapter on growing old&mdash;marked in pencil&mdash;a subject which the author
of this book knew nothing about, never having grown old himself. And
there is another chapter about a spinster, also marked. This chap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>ter
sings with exquisite melody, but breaks once to a sob for a love that
has been lost. But the book is chiefly about children.</p>

<p>There is one particular sentence in this book with which I am not in
agreement. "... down the laughing avenues of childhood, where memory
tells us we run but once...." I cannot believe that. I cannot believe
we run but once. In the heart of the man who wrote the book there
lives a child. And a child dwells in the heart of the woman of the
lending library.</p>

<p>We are too ready to believe that childhood passes with the years&mdash;that
its fine imagination is blunted with the hard practice of the world.
Too long have we been taught that the clouds of glory fade in the
common day&mdash;that the lofty castles of the morning perish in the
noon-day sun. The magic vista is golden to the coming of the twilight,
and the sunset builds a gaudy tower that out-tops the dawn. If a man
permits, a child keeps house within his heart to the very end.</p>

<p>And therefore, as I think of those whittled daggers with their spot of
blood, of that popping pistol, of the captain's horrid hook, of the
black craft flying the skull and crossbones in the attic, I know,
despite appearance, that I am young myself. I snap my fingers at the
clock. It ticks merely for its own amusement. I proclaim the calendar
is false. The sun rises and sets but makes no chilling notch upon the
heart. Once again, despite the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span> weary signpost of the years, I run on
the laughing avenues of childhood.</p>

<p class="center"><br />
<img src="images/gear.png" width="420" height="118" alt="pirate gear" title="pirate gear" />
<br /><br /></p>

<p>My preface outstays its time. Even as I write our audience has
gathered. Limber folk in front squat on the floor. Bearded folk behind
perch on chairs as on a balcony. Already, behind the scenes, the
captain of the pirates has assumed his hook and villainous attire.
Patch-Eye mumbles his lines against a loss of memory. Paint has daubed
him to a rascal. The evil Duke limps for practice on his timber leg.
Presently our curtain will rise. We shall see the pirate cabin, with
the lighthouse blinking in the distance, the parrot, Flint's lantern
and the ladder to the sleeping loft. We shall hear a storm
unparalleled, like a tempest from the ocean&mdash;hissed through the teeth.
We shall see the pirates in tattered costume and in pigtails made of
stockings.</p>

<p>And now to bring this tedious explanation to a close, permit me to
hush our orchestra for a final word. I have a most important
announcement. It is the sum and essence of all these pages. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span> play
of pirates&mdash;doctored somewhat with fiercer oaths and lengthened for
older actors&mdash;this play and my other play of beggars I dedicate with
my love to <i>John Abram Flory</i>, who, as Red Joe, was the most frightful
pirate of them all.</p>

<h3>ON CHOOSING A TITLE</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="dropcap">I</span>&nbsp;<b>FIND</b> difficulty in selecting a name for my pirate play. Children
seem so easy in comparison&mdash;John or Gretchen, or Gwendolyn for parents
of romantic taste. Gwendolyn I myself dislike, and I have thought I
would give it to a cow if ever I owned a farm. But this is prejudice.
To name a child, I repeat, one needs only to run his finger down the
column of his acquaintance, or think which aunt will have the looser
purse-strings in her will.</p>

<p>An unhappy choice, after all, is rare. Here and there a chocolate
Pearl or a dusky crinkle-headed Blanche escapes our logic; but who can
think of a sullen Nancy? Its very sound, tossed about the nursery,
would brighten a maiden even if she were peevish at the start. I once
knew an excellent couple of the name of Bottom, who chose Ruby for
their offspring; but I have no doubt that the in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>felicity was altered
at the font. The fact is that most of our names grow in time to fit
our figure and our character. Margaret and Helen sound thin or fat,
agreeable or dull, as our friends and neighbors rise before us; and
any newcomer to our affection quickly erases the aspect of its former
ugly tenant. I confess that till lately a certain name brought to my
fancy a bouncing, red-armed creature; but that by a change of lease
upon our street it has acquired an alien grace and beauty. Perhaps a
scrawny neighbor by the name of Falstaff might remain inconsequent,
but I am sure that if a lady called Messilina moved in next door and
were of charming manner, a month would blur the bad suggestion of her
name; which presently&mdash;if our gardens ran together&mdash;would come to
sound sweetly in my ears.</p>

<p>But a play (more than a child or neighbor) is offered for a sudden
judgment&mdash;to sink or swim upon a first impression&mdash;and its christening
is an especial peril. I have fretted for a month to find a title for
my comedy.</p>

<p>My first choice was <i>A Frightful Play of Pirates</i>. In the word
<i>frightful</i> lay the double meaning that I wanted. It held up my hands,
as it were, for mercy. It is an old device. Did not Keats, when a
novice in his art, attempt by a modest preface to disarm the critics
of his Endymion? "It is just," he wrote, "that this youngster should
die away." Yet my title was too long. I could not hope, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span> my comedy
reached the boards, that a manager could afford such a long display of
electric lights above the door. It would require more than a barrel of
lamps.</p>

<p><i>The Pirates of Clovelly</i> was not bad, except for length, but it was
too obviously stolen from Gilbert's opera. I could feel my guilty
fingers in his pocket.</p>

<p><i>'S Death</i> was suggested, but it was too flippant, too farcical. <i>'S
Blood</i>, although effective in red lights, met the same objection. <i>The
Spittin' Devil</i>, named for our pirate ship, lacked refinement.
Certainly no lady in silk and lace would admit acquaintance with so
gross a personage.</p>

<p><i>Darlin'</i> was offered to me&mdash;the name of the old lady with one tooth
who cooks and mixes the grog for my sailormen. And I still think that
with better spelling it would be an excellent title for musical
comedy. But it was naught for a pirate play. Its anemia would soften
the vigor of my lines. One could as well call the tale of Bluebeard by
the name of his casual cook.</p>

<p>Then <i>Clovelly</i> seemed enough. At the very least&mdash;if my publisher were
energetic&mdash;it ensured a brisk sale of the printed play among the
American tourists on the Devon coast, who travel by boat or
char-a-banc to this ancient fishing village where we set our plot. For
even a trivial book sells to trippers if its story is laid around the
corner. Would it not be pleasant, I thought, when I visit the place
again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span> to see them thumbing me as they waited for the steamer&mdash;to see
a whole window of myself placed in equal prominence with picture
postal cards? When I registered at the inn alongside the wharf might I
not hope that the landlady would recognize my name and give me, as an
honored guest, a front room that looks upon the ocean? Perhaps, as I
had my tea and clotted cream on the village staircase, I might mention
casually to a pretty tourist that I was the author of the book that
protruded from her handbag&mdash;and fetch my dishes to her table.</p>

<p>It is so seldom that an obscure author catches anyone <i>flagrante
delicto</i> on his book. Will no one ever read a book of mine in the
subway, that I may tap him on the shoulder? Do travelers never put me
in their grips? Must everyone read in public the latest novel, and
reserve all plays and essays for their solitary hours? At the club I
shuffle to the top any periodical that contains my name, but the
crowded noon buries me deep again.</p>

<p>At best, maybe, in a lending library, I see a date stamped inside my
cover; but, although I linger near the shelf, no one comes to draw me
down. I think that hunters must look with equal hunger on the bear's
tread. 'T is here! 'T is there! But the cunning creature has escaped.
Blackmore's pleasant ghost frequents the shadowy church at Porlock
where he married Lorna and John Ridd, or roams the Valley of the Rocks
to see the studious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span> pilgrims at his pages. Stevenson haunts the
gloomy inlet where the Admiral Benbow stood and where old Pew came
tapping in the night. In the flesh I shall join their revels as an
equal comrade. <i>Clovelly</i>, however, although its lilt was pleasant to
the ear, was an insufficient title.</p>

<p><i>Skull and Crossbones</i> was too obvious, and my next choice was <i>The
Gibbet</i>. But there was the disadvantage of scaring the timid. Old
ladies would pass me by. It would check the sale of tickets. My
nephew, who is fourteen and not at all timid, was stout in its
defense. He pronounces it as if the <i>g</i> were the hard kind that starts
off gurgle. <i>G</i>ibbet! He asked me if I had a hanging in the piece. If
so, he knew how the business could be managed without chance of
accident&mdash;an extra rope fastened to the belt behind. I told him that
it was none of his business how I ended up the pirates. I would hang
them or not, as I saw fit. He would have to pay his quarter like
anybody else and sit it through.</p>

<p>He suggested From <i>Dish-Pan to Matrimony</i>&mdash;obviously a jest. The sly
rogue laughs at me. I must confess, however, that he has given me some
of my best lines. "Villainy 's afoot!" for example, and "Sink me stern
up!" His peaceful school breeds a wealth of pungent English.</p>

<p>I was in despair. <i>Revenge!</i> Would that have done? I see a maddened
father stand with smoking revolver above the body of a silky-whiskered
villain. "Doris," the panting parent cries, "the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span> butcher boy knows
all and wants you for his bride." And down comes the happy curtain on
the lovers. <i>The Wreckers</i> belongs to Stevenson. <i>The Pirates' Nest!</i>
It is too ornithological. The Natural History Museum might buy a copy
and think I had cheated them.</p>

<p>And then <i>Channel Lights</i>! It sends us sharply to the days of the
older melodrama&mdash;days when we exchanged a ten-cent piece for a gallery
seat and hissed the villain. Do you recall the breathless moment when
the heroine implored the villain to give her back her stolen child?
For answer the cruel fellow tied the darling to the buzz-saw. Or that
darker scene when he tossed the lady to the black waters of the
Thames, with the splash of a dipper up behind? Hurry, master hero!
Your horse's hoofs clatter in the wings. Gallop, Dobbin! A precious
life depends upon your speed. Our dangerous plot hangs by a single
thread.</p>

<p>It is quite a task to find a sufficient title. I have wavered for a
month.</p>

<p>But now my efforts seem rewarded.</p>

<p>There is a wharf in London below the Tower, not far from the India
docks. It has now sunk to common week-day uses, and I suppose its
rotten timbers are piled with honest, unromantic merchandise. But once
pirates were hanged there. It was the first convenient place for
inbound ships to dispose of this dirty, deep-sea cargo. Doubtless
hereabout the lanes and building-tops were crowded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span> with an idle
throng as on a holiday, and wherries to the bankside and the play
paused with suspended oar for a sight of the happy festival. Did
Hamlet wait upon this ghastly prologue? Shakespeare himself, unplayed
script in hand, mused how tragedy and farce go hand in hand. In those
golden days with which our comedy concerns itself, a gibbet stood on
Wapping wharf and pirates stepped off the fatal cart to a hangman's
jest. We may hear the shouts of the 'prentice lads echoing across the
centuries.</p>

<p>I cannot hope that many persons&mdash;except dusty scholars&mdash;will know of
the district's ancient ill-repute, yet Wapping wharf figures often in
my dialogue as the somber motif of a pirate's life. It conveys to the
plot the sense of mystery. It needs but a handful of electric lamps.</p>

<p>If no one offers me a better title I shall let it stand.</p>

<h1>Wappin&#8217; Wharf</h1>

<h2><i>A Frightful Comedy of Pirates</i></h2>

<h3>ACT I</h3>


<p class="hang"><i>Our scene is the wind-swept coast of Devon. By day there is a wide
stretch of ocean far below. The time is remote and doubtless great
ships of forgotten build stand out from Bristol in full sail for
western shores. Their white canvas winks in the morning sun as if
their purpose were a jest. They seek a northwest passage and the
golden mines of India. But we must be loose and free of date lest our
plot be shamed by broken fact. A thousand years are but as yesterday.
We shall make no more than a general gesture toward the wide spaces of
the past.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>The village of Clovelly climbs in a single street&mdash;a staircase,
really&mdash;from the shore to the top of the cliff, and is fagged and out
of breath half way. But on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span> still dizzier crag, storm-blown,
clinging by its toes, there stands the pirates' cabin. To this topmost
ledge fishwives sometimes scramble by day to seek a belated sail
against Lundy's Isle. But after twilight a night wind searches the
crannies of the rock and whines to the moon of its barren quest, and
then no villager, I think, chooses to walk in that direction. I have
visited Clovelly and have kicked a sodden donkey from the wharf to the
top of the street, past the shops of Devon cream and picture postal
cards, but have sought in vain the pirates' cabin. Since our far-off
adventure of tonight ten thousand tempests have snarled across these
giddy cliffs and we must convince our reason that these highest crags
where we pitch our plot have long since been toppled in a storm. Where
yonder wave lathers the shaggy headland, as if Neptune had turned
barber, we must fancy that the pinnacles of yesteryear lie buried in
the sea.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>We had hoped for a play upon the sea, with a tall mast rocking from
wing to wing and a tempest roaring at the rail. Alas! Our pirates grow
old and stiff. They have retired, as we say, from active practice and
live in idle luxury on shore. Yet we shall see that their villainy
still thrives.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Our scene is their cabin on the cliff. It is a rough stone building
with peeling plaster and slates that by day are green with moss. But
it is night and the wind is whistling its rowdy companions from the
sea. Until the morning they will play at leap-frog<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span> from cliff to
cliff. Far below is the village of Clovelly, snug with fire and
candles.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>We enter the cabin without knocking&mdash;like neighbors through a
garden&mdash;and poke about a bit before our hosts appear. A door, forward
at the right, leads to the kitchen. Back stage, also, at the right, a
ladder rises to a sleeping loft. On the left wall are a chimney and
fireplace with a crane and pot for heating grog, and smoky timbers
above to mark the frequent thirst. On a great beam overhead are bags
of clinking loot and shining brasses from wrecked ships. Peppers hang
to dry before the fire, and a lighted ship's lantern swings from a
hook. At the rear of the cabin, to the left, a row of mullioned
windows looks at sea and cliffs in a flash of lightning. Below is a
seaman's chest. Above, on the broken plaster, is scrawled a ship. In
the middle, at the rear, there is a clock with hanging pendulum and
weights. A gun of antique pattern leans beside the clock. To the right
the cabin is recessed, with a door right-angled in the jog and other
windows looking on the sea. A parrot sits on its perch with curbed
profanity. The gaudy creature is best if stuffed, for its noisy tongue
would drown our dialogue. Like Hamlet's player it would speak beyond
its lines and raise a quantity of barren laughter. Our furniture is a
table and three stools, and a tall-backed chair beside the hearth. On
the table a candle burns, bespattered with tallow. The cabin glows
with fire light.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">Two pirates are discovered drinking at a table<br /><br /></p>

<p class="hang"><i>At the lifting of the curtain there is thunder and lightning, and a
rush of wind&mdash;if it can be managed. Two pirates are discovered,
drinking at the table. By the smack of their lips it is excellent
grog. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span> of them&mdash;Patch-Eye&mdash;has lost an eye and he wears a black
patch. His hair curls up in a pigtail, like any sailor before Nelson.
It looks as stiff as a hook and he might almost be lifted by it and
hung on a peg. But all of our pirates wear pigtails&mdash;except one, Red
Joe.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>The other pirate at the table is called the Duke, for no apparent
reason as he is a shabby rogue. We must not run our finger down the
peerage in hope of finding him, or think that he owns a palace on the
Strand. He has only one leg, with a timber below the knee. He wears a
long cloak so that the actor's rusticated leg can be folded out of
sight. The Duke has a great red nose&mdash;grog and rum and that sort of
thing. His whiskers are the bush that marks the merry drinking place.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Patch-Eye is melancholy&mdash;almost sentimental at times. He would stab a
man, but grieve upon a sparrow. At heart we fear he is a coward, and
stupid. The Duke, on the contrary, is shrewd and he does a lot of
thinking. He has heavy eyebrows. He is the kind of thinker that you
just know that he is thinking. Both pirates are very cruel&mdash;and
profane, but we must be careful.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>And now we hush the melancholy fiddlers. If this comedy can stir the
croaking bass-viol to any show of mirth, our work tops Falstaff. Glum
folk with beards had best withdraw. Only the young in heart will catch
the slender meaning of our play. Let's light the candles and draw the
curtain!</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: Darlin'! Darlin'! (<i>He lolls back in his chair and stretches
out his legs for comfort.</i>) Darlin'!</p>

<p class="hangbl">(<i>At this a dirty old woman with one tooth appears from the kitchen.
She is called Darlin' just for fun, as she is not at all kissable. A
sprig of mistletoe, even in the Christmas season, would beckon
vainly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: Me friend, the Duke, is thirsty. Will yer fill the cups? Hurry,
ol' dear! And squeeze in jest a bit o' lemon. It sets the stomich.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darlin'</span>: Yer sets yer stomich like it were hen's eggs. Alers coddlin'
it.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>She stirs and tastes the pot of grog, and hoists her wrinkled
stockings.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: There 's no one like Darlin' fer mixin' grog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darlin'</span>: Fer that kind word I 'm lovin' yer. (<i>She looks at him with
admiration.</i>) Ain 't he a figger o' a man? Wenus was nothin'. Jest
nothin' at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: It 's grog beats off the melancholy. As soon as me pipes go
dry, I gets homesick fer the ocean. Here we be, Duke, thrown up at
last ter rot like driftwood on the shore. No more sailin' off to
Trinidad! No tackin' 'round the Hebrides! We is ships as has sprung a
leak. It was 'appy days when we sailed with ol' Flint on the Spanish
Main.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: 'Appy days, Patch! (<i>They drink.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: Aye! The blessed, dear, ol' roarin' hulk. No better pirate ever
lived than Flint. Smart with his cutlass. Quick at the trigger. Grog!
A sloppin' pail o' it was jest a sip.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: I used ter tell him that his leg was holler.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: He was a vat, was Flint&mdash;jest a swishin' keg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: Grog jest sizzled and disappeared, like when yer drops it on a
red-hot seacoal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: Fer twenty year and more me and you has seen ol' Flint march
his wictims off the plank.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: "Step lively!" he 'd say. "Does n't yer hear Davy callin' to
yer?" There was never a sailorman ever sat in the Port Light at
Wappin' wharf which could drink with Flint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: Wappin' wharf and gibbets is nothin' ter talk about. Funerals
even is cheerfuller.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: There 's his parrot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: She used ter cuss soft and gentle to herself&mdash;'appy all the
day. She ain 't spoke since Flint was took. Peckin' at yer finger and
broodin'.</p>

fer a bouncin' ship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: She was tickin' peaceful the day Flint was hanged. But she
stopped&mdash;does yer remember it?&mdash;the very minute they pushed him off
the ladder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: She ain 't ticked since.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: It makes yer 'stitious. And she won 't never run agin&mdash;that 's
what Flint alers said&mdash;till his death 's revenged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: He told us never ter wind her&mdash;says she 'd start hisself without
no windin' when the right time came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: If I was ter look up and see that pendulum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span> swingin'&mdash;Horrers!
Yeller elephants would be nothin'!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: Pooh! I 'd give a month o' grog jest ter hear the ol' dear
tickin', and ter know that Flint was restin' easy in his rotten
coffin&mdash;swappin' stories with the pretty angels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: I loved Flint like a brother. (<i>He is quite sentimental about
this.</i>) It was him knocked this out. (<i>Pointing to his missing eye.</i>)
But it was jest in the way o' business. We differed a leetle in the
loot. He was very persuasive, was ol' Flint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: Yer talks like a woman. They loves yer to cuff 'em. Them was
'appy days, Patch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: Blast me gig what 's left, Duke, but me and you has seen a heap
o' sights. I suppose I 've drowned meself a hundred men. It 's
comfertin' when yer lays awake at night. I feels I ain 't wasted
meself. I 've used me gifts. I ain 't been a foolish virgin and put me
shinin' talent inside a bushel. But me and you is driftwood now, Duke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: Aye. But it ain 't no use snifflin' about it, ol' crocodile.
Darlin' is certainly handy at mixin' grog. And we 've a right smart
cabin with winders on the sea. Since I stuffed yer ol' shirt in the
roof it hardly leaks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: My shirt! Next week is me week fer changin'. How could yer ha'
done it? I 'm a kinder perticerler dresser. I likes ter wash now and
then&mdash;if it ain 't too often.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: Darlin', me friend Patch is thirsty. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span> a drop meself. (<i>The
cups are filled.</i>) Yer a precious ol' lady, and I loves yer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darlin'</span>: Yer spoils me, Duke.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Lightning and a crash of thunder.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: It 's foul tonight on the ocean. How the wind blows! It be
spittin' up outside. The channel 's as riled as a wampire when yer
scorns her. How she snorts!</p>

<p>Dropped inter the Port Light fer somethin' wet and warmin'. Jest ter
kinder say goodby. Ship all fitted out. He 'd got three new
sailormen&mdash;fine fellers as had been sentenced ter be hanged fer
cuttin' purses, but had been let go, as they had reformed and wanted
ter be honest pirates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: I remembers the night, ol' sea-nymph. It was rainin' ter put out
the fires o' hell&mdash;with the leetle devils stoakin' in the sinners. It
's sinners, Patch, as is used fer kindlers, ter keep the devils in a
healthy sweat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: He was ter sail when the tide ran out. Lord a Goody! How the
tide runs down the Thames, as if it were homesick fer the ocean!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: But someone squealed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: Squealers is worse 'n hissin' reptiles. They ketched Flint and
they strung him to a gibbet. Poor ol' dear! I never touches me patch,
but I thinks o' Flint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: This here life is snug and easy. We has retired from practice,
like store-keepers does who has made a fortin. Ain 't we settin' here
in style and comfert, and jest waitin' fer the treasure ships ter come
ter us? We gets the plums without chawin' at the dough. We blows out
the lighthouse, and we sets our lantern so as ter fool 'em on the
course, and when they smashes on the rocks, well&mdash;all we does is stuff
our pokes with the treasure that washes up. I prays meself fer fog and
dirty weather. Now I lay me, says I, and will yer send it thick and
oozy?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: I ain 't disputin' yer. (<i>He cheers up a bit.</i>) And we robs
landlubbers once in a while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: Now yer talkin', ol' sea-lion. I 'm tellin' yer it were a good
haul we made last night on Castle Crag.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: Who 's disputin' yer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: I 'm tellin' yer. Silver candles! And spoons! Never seen such a
heap o' spoons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: What 's anyone want more 'n one spoon fer? Yer cleans it every
bite agin the tongue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: Yer disgusts me, Patch. Yer ain 't no manners. Fer meself I
spears me food tidy on me knife.</p>

yer. (<i>He goes to the chest, opens it and draws out a rich velvet
garment. He holds it up.</i>) What 's the meaning o' this here loot we
took at Castle Crag? I asks yer. Ain 't we been by that castle a
hundred times? The Earl, he don 't wear clothes like this. None o' the
arstocky does, 'cept when they struts on Piccadilly. I asks yer,
Patch. I asks yer who wears a thing like that.</p>

another pot. Our cups is low. Yer does n't want ter be a foolish
virgin and get ketched without no grog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: Y-e-s. I think so. I don 't know. Old Nancy, they called

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: Who was old Nancy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: And Darlin'?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: Yes. She has been good to me. And the others, too. I seem to
remember someone else. How long have you been a pirate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: A pirate? Years, it seems, my dear. But I am more used to a
soldier's oaths. I have trailed a pike in the Lowland wars. The roar
of cannon, and siege and falling walls, are gayer tunes than any ocean
tempest. What is this that you remember, Betsy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: It is far off. Some one sang to me. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span> was not Nancy. When
Nancy died, Darlin' took me and brought me up. That was three years
ago. But last year the Captain and Duke and Patch-Eye came climbing up
the rocks. They were sailormen, they said, who had lost a ship. And
these cliffs with the sea pounding on the shore comforted them when
they were lonely. So they stayed. And Darlin' and I cook for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: Do you remember who it was who sang to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: That song you just sang&mdash;where did you learn it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: I have always known it. It makes me sad to sing it, for it sets
me thinking&mdash;thinking of something that I have forgotten. (<i>She stands
at the window above the sea.</i>) Some days I climb high on the cliffs
and I look upon the ocean. And I know that there is land beyond&mdash;where
children play&mdash;but I see nothing but a rim of water. And sometimes the
wind comes off the sea, and it brings me familiar far-off
voices&mdash;voices I once knew&mdash;voices I once knew&mdash;fragments from a life
I have forgotten. Why do you ask about my song?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: Because I heard it once myself.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Betsy sits beside him at the table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: Where? Perhaps, if you will tell me, it will help me to
remember.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: I heard the song once when I was a lad&mdash;when I was taken on a
visit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: Were your parents pirates?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: It was a long journey and all day we bumped upon the road,
seeking an outlet from the tangled hills. Night overtook our weary
horses and blew out the flaming candles in the west; and shadows were
a blanket on the sleeping world. Toward midnight I was roused. We had
come to the courtyard of a house&mdash;this house where I was taken on a
visit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: Was it like this, Joe&mdash;a cabin on a cliff?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: I remember how the moon peeped around the corner to see who came
so late knocking on the door. I remember&mdash;I remember&mdash;(<i>He stops
abruptly</i>). Do you remember when you first came to live with Nancy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: I dreamed once&mdash;you will think me silly&mdash;Are there great stone
steps somewhere, wider than this room, with marble women standing
motionless? And walls with dizzy towers upon them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: Go on, Betsy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: In Clovelly there are naught but cabins pitched upon a hill,
and ladders to a loft. And, at the foot of the town, a mole, where
boats put in. And I have listened to the songs of the fishermen as
they wind their nets. And through the window of the tavern I have
heard them singing at their rum. And sometimes I have been afraid. I
have stuffed my ears and ran. But the ugly songs have followed me and
scared me in the night. The shadows from the moon have reeled across
the floor, like a tipsy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span> sailor from the Harbor Light. Joe, are you
really a man from the sea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: Why, Betsy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: The sea is never gentle. It never sleeps. I have stood
listening at the window on breathless nights, but the ocean always
slaps against the rocks. Even in a calm it moves and frets. Is it not
said that the ghosts of evil men walk back and forth on the spot where
their crimes are done? The ocean, perhaps, for its cruel wreckage,
haunts these cliffs. It is doomed through all eternity with a lather
of breaking waves to wash these rocks of blood. And the wind whistles
to bury the cries of drowning men that plague the memory. Joe&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: Yes, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: You are the only one&mdash;Patch-Eye, Duke and the Captain&mdash;you are
the only one who is always gentle. And I have wondered if you could
really be a pirate.</p>

my softer twin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: Don 't! Don 't!</p>

Of the last bubbles that grin upon the surface where a dozen men have
drowned?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: Joe! For God's sake! Don 't!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: Is it gentleness to plunge a dagger in a man and watch for his
dying eye to glaze?</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>:</span> Two weeks? So short a time. From Monday to Monday and then
around again to Monday. It is so brief a space that a flower would
scarcely droop and wither. And yet the day you came seems already long
ago. And all the days before are of a different life. It was another
Betsy, not myself, who lived in this cabin on a Sunday before a
Monday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: It is so always, Betsy, when friends suddenly come to know each
other. All other days sink to unreality like the memory of snow upon a
day of August. We wonder how the flowering meadows were once a field
of white. Our past selves, Betsy, walk apart from us and, although we
know their trick of attitude and the fashion of their clothes, they
are not ourselves. For friendship, when it grips the heart, rewinds
the fibres of our being. Do you remember, dear, how you ran in fright
when you first saw me clambering up these rocks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: I was sent to call the Duke to dinner and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span> carried a bell to
ring it on the cliff. I was afraid when a stranger's head appeared
upon the path.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: Yet, when I spoke, you stopped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: At the first word I knew I need n't be afraid. And you took my
hand to help me up the slope. You asked my name, and told me yours was
Joe. Then we came together to this cabin. And each day I have been
with you. Two weeks only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: I shall be gone, Betsy, in a little while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: Gone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: I am not, my dear, the master of myself. We must forget these
days together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: Joe!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: May be I shall return. Fate is captain. The future shows so
vaguely in the mist. Listen! It is the Duke.</p>

lightning, but it is a dirty night of fog&mdash;as wet as a crocodile's

before, shows vaguely through the mist.</i></p>

presently in his courtship; for marvelously it sharpens a lover's

told, go so far as to consult the almanac when laying in their store
of wedding fits; for a cloudy June throws Cupid off his aim. What
cosmetic&mdash;what rouge or powder&mdash;so paints a beauty! If the moon were
full twice within the month scarcely a bachelor would be left. I pray
you, master car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>penter, hang me up a moon. But our plot has put its
foot down. "Mirk," it says, "mirk and fog are best for our dirty
business."</i></p>

pirate ship, rocking in a storm. Such high excitement is your right,

of a mound of turf for the tread of a peasant's foot? Where is now the
ermine robe, the glistening crown, the harness of a fighting hour, the
sceptre that marked the giddy office, the voice, the flashing eye that
stirred a coward to bravery, the iron gauntlet shaking in the pallid
face of France? All&mdash;all covered by a spadeful of country earth.

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: I rely on my sailors to clear the coast and seas. But first I
want your allegiance in another high concern. Some fourteen years ago,
when I was a lad of ten, I journeyed with my royal father to the
castle of the Duke of Cornwall, which stands high on the wind-swept
coast. Its giddy towers rise sheer above the ocean until the very
rooks nesting in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span> battlements grow dizzy at the height. It is the
outer bastion of the world, laughing to scorn the ocean's siege.</p>

<p>In that castle, Captain, there lived a little girl; and she and I
romped the sounding corridors together. And once I led her to an open
'brasure in the steep-pitched wall, and held her so that she might see
the waves curling on the rocks below. And tales of mermaids I
invented, and shipwreck and treasure buried in the noisy caverns of
the rock, where twice a day the greedy tide goes in and out to seek
its fortune. And far afield we wandered and stood waist-deep in the
golden meadows, until the weary twilight called us home.</p>

<p>And I remember, when tired with play, that her mother sang to us an
old song, a lullaby. Her voice was soft, with a gentleness that only a
mother knows who sits with drowsy children.</p>

<p>And to that little girl I was betrothed. It was sworn with oath and
signature that some day I would marry her and that, when I became king
of England in the revolving years, she would be its queen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: By what miracle did you know me, Hal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: It was the song you sang. Your voice was the miracle that told
the secret. With unvarnished speech I woo you. I love you, Margaret,
and I ask you to be my wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: My gracious lord, for these three years this cabin has been my
home. These are my friends&mdash;the only friends I have ever known. They
fed me when I had no food and they kept me warm against the cold. Must
they hang? I ask you to pardon them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darlin'</span>: Glory ter God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: The pardon is granted. Captain, strike off their irons!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: It were jest an hour ago, settin' in that chair, I asks ter
splice yer, Betsy, keel ter topsail. The ol' Duke never thought the
Countess of all them places, and the Queen o' England, ter boot, would
ever be settin' on his knee, pullin' at his whiskers&mdash;him askin' her
ter name the 'appy day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: It was a prior attachment, Duke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain</span>: We 'll serve yer, King, like we served ol' Flint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: Top and bottom, fore and aft.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: We 'll brag how the King o' England and us has drunk grog
together, and how the Queen washed up the mugs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meg</span>: (<i>in a whisper</i>). Hooray!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: And now, Captain, lead the way. We must speed to London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy</span>: Good by, Duke. Some day you will find a girl who cooks roast
pig that crackles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: A blessin', Betsy, on yer laughin' eyes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain</span>: A health ter King Hal and his blushin' bride!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span>: King Hal! Leetle Betsy!</p>

her fingers to the pirates in farewell. The sailors follow. The
pirates and Darlin' are left. The pirates sit at the table. They
exchange glances of satisfaction. They unbutton for a quiet evening at
home. Kings are but an episode in a pirate's life. They return to the
happy routine of their lives. Our adventure has circled to its
start.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: Darlin'! Me friend, the Duke, is thirsty. Yer had better mix
another pot o' grog. Yer does n't want ter be a foolish virgin and get
ketched without no grog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: The Duke, he knows a leetle dear as is jest waitin' ter come
flutterin' ter his lovin' arms. I thinks it 's yer whiskers, Duke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain</span>: Yer can pull one, Betsy, fer the locket that yer wears. We is
laughin' at yer, ol' walrus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>: Kings is bigger than Dukes. I looses without no kickin' up.
There 's no one like Darlin' fer mixin' grog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darlin'</span>: Fer that kind word I 'm lovin' yer.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>She fills the cups.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patch</span>: It 's grog beats off the melancholy. As soon as me pipes goes
dry, I gets homesick fer the ocean. Here we be, Duke, thrown up at
last ter rot like driftwood on the shore. It was 'appy days when we
sailed with ol' Flint on the Spanish Main.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain</span>: 'Appy days, Patch!</p>

<p><i>Our candles have burned to socket. Our pasteboard cabin is bare and
dark. No longer do pirate flags flaunt the ghostly seas. The stormy
ocean, the dizzy cliffs of Devon, melt like an unsubstantial pageant.
Let's put away our toys&mdash;the timber leg, the patch, the frightful
hook. Once again, despite the weary signpost of the years, we have run
on the laughing avenues of childhood.</i></p>
